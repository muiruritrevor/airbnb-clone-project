- **Guests** leave **reviews** for properties they have booked.
 
## Feature Breakdown

### **1. User Management**
Enables users to **sign up, log in, and manage their profiles**. Hosts can list properties, while guests can browse and book accommodations. Secure authentication ensures that user data remains protected.

### **2. Property Management**
Hosts can **create, edit, and manage property listings**, including descriptions, pricing, and images. This feature ensures guests have comprehensive details when choosing accommodations.

### **3. Booking System**
Guests can **search for available properties and make reservations** for specific dates. The system automatically prevents double bookings and ensures availability.

### **4. Payment Processing**
Secure payment gateways allow guests to **pay for their bookings** using methods like credit cards or PayPal. Transactions are encrypted to prevent fraud and unauthorized access.

### **5. Review System**
Guests can **rate and review properties** based on their stay experience. Hosts receive feedback, helping improve property quality while guiding future guests in decision-making.

### **6. Search & Filtering**
Users can **search properties by location, price, amenities, and availability**. Advanced filters improve the booking experience by helping guests find listings that best match their needs.

### **7. API Security**
Implements **authentication, authorization, encryption, and rate limiting** to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Security measures ensure safe transactions and user interactions.

### **8. CI/CD Pipeline**
Automates **building, testing, and deployment** processes using tools like **GitHub Actions and Docker**. Ensures continuous integration, reducing downtime and making updates seamless.

## API Security 

### **Key Security Measures**
#### 1. **Authentication**
- Uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication.
- Ensures users log in before accessing restricted resources.
- Prevents unauthorized access to accounts.

* Protects user credentials and secures private data from unauthorized access.

#### 2. **Authorization**
- Role-based access control (**RBAC**) determines user permissions.
- Ensures **guests**, **hosts**, and **admins** have appropriate access.
- Restricts sensitive operations (e.g., property modifications).

* Prevents unauthorized users from making changes or accessing confidential information.

#### 3. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
- Limits the number of API requests **per user/IP** to prevent abuse.
- Protects against **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks**.
- Implemented using **API gateways** or tools like **Redis**.

* Prevents excessive API usage, ensuring server stability and availability.

#### 4. **Data Encryption**
- **TLS/SSL** encryption secures data in transit.
- **AES encryption** ensures sensitive data (e.g., passwords & payments) is safely stored.
- Avoids **plain-text storage** of credentials.

* Keeps user data safe from interception or leakage.

#### 5. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- Prevents **SQL injection**, **XSS (Cross-site scripting)**, and other exploits.
- Uses strict validation for user inputs.
- Escapes or removes harmful characters before processing requests.

* Protects against malicious attacks targeting APIs via untrusted inputs.

#### 6. **Secure Payment Handling**
- Payments are processed through **trusted third-party gateways** (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- Implements **tokenized transactions** for added security.
- Monitors and logs suspicious payment activities.

* Ensures financial transactions remain secure and prevents fraud.

#### 7. **Logging & Monitoring**
- Tracks API usage and security events.
- Detects unauthorized access attempts via **audit logs**.
- Uses tools like **Splunk**, **ELK Stack**, or **CloudWatch**.

* Helps detect and respond to threats in real time
